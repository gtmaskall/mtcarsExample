# Introduction

We introduce a never-before-seen data set and perform the best
ever statistical analysis on it.

# The data

It's something to do with cars:

```{r, mtcarsSummary}
summary(mtcars)
```

# The best plot in the world

The summary of years of analysis is this relationship between
mpg and weight.

```{r, mpgwt, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
plot(mpg ~ wt, mtcars)
```

Okay okay, I'll do something more colourful.

```{r, ggplotColour, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
library(ggplot2)
ghist <- ggplot(data = mtcars) + 
            geom_histogram(aes(x = mpg, fill = as.factor(cyl)), binwidth = 1) +
            labs(fill = "cyl")
print(ghist)
```
